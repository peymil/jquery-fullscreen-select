## Basic Usage

Create your `<select>` with the `.mobileSelect` class.

```html
<select class="mobileSelect">
	<option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
	<option value="burger">Burger</option>
	<option value="tacos">Tacos</option>
	<option value="garlic-bread">Garlic Bread</option>

$('.mobileSelect').mobileSelect();
```

```js
// To style all <select>s
$('select').mobileSelect();
```
